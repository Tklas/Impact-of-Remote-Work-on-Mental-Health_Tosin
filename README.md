Key Insights

From the dataset, we can see some of the key insights which is highighted below;

The dataset is separated into four gender categories which are; the male gender, female, binary and then others who refused to say, from this analysis we can see that the male gender tends to have a lot more working hours as compared to other genders with a total work hours of 50.8k total working hours weekly

The region with the highest number of mental health condition is Africa

Companies tend to support more people with bumout mental health condition as opposed to other mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety etc. maybe because it has more serious implications than the rest

The industry that offers more support to mental health conditions is the finance industry. other industries support but the finance industry has the highest rate of support unlike the education industry that supports the least

The sum of weekly work hours decreases the productivity of individuals by 68%

The Female gender has better work-life balance as compared to other genders


Recommendations

I made the below recommendations folowing the key insights i derived from this analysis;

As the female gender has better work-ife balance, I recommend that other genders also work towards having a work-life balance as well expecially the male gender which has the most cases of mental health condidions due to longer work hours.

I recommend engaging in physical activities to keep the bosy in shape, quality sleep, moderate work hours and speaking to a consultant whenever they are under presure or stress or notice any change in their health

Other industries need to emulate the finance industry and also provide necessary support to the remote workers whereby they can easily have access to mental condition resources even if they have not been diagnosed yet.

The higher the weekly work hours, the more decrease in productivity of the workers hence i recommend a review in the work hours to make it moderateÂ
